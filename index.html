	<p>
	Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I hope you enjoy the contents of this website and that it is 
	successful in showcasing my skills in Data Science.  I also hope that it can be of service to those interested in Data Science.</p>
				
		
<p id="aboutme"><h4>About Me</h4></p>
		
		<p>My interest in Data Science began after I learned about the 
		job possibilities that I could possibly do after I earned my MBA.
		Since that time, I have been periodically learning about this 
		subject and working on a few projects here and there on the side
		while I have been working full-time at my Medical Technologist job.
		</p>
		
		<p>It is a desire of mine to obtain a work from home position.
		I do have experience working from home since this is how I 
		earned my MBA.</p>

	<p id="learned"><h4>Miscellaneous Concepts I have learned</h4></p>	

		On November 11, 2020, I was motivated by 
		<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/184005">this discussion</a> in a Kaggle 
		competition to learn from 
		<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-pytorch-lets-you-build-and-experiment-with-a-neural-net-de079b25a3e0">this article</a> that Pytorch is 
		very similar in concept to Tensorflow but uses different coding to 
		essentially do the same thing.  <br />
		
		I also learned from 
		<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-lab-evolution-of-the-jupyter-notebook-5297cacde6b">this article</a> that 
		I would like to start using JupyterLab rather than Jupyter Notebooks
		to do coding work.  I really liked how you can do the dark theme with
		JupyterLab which required code to accomplish this in Jupyter Notebook.<br />
		
		I have also determined that when I write notebooks, I need to state
		the objective of what the notebook is trying to accomplish.  I also 
		need to state what each line of code is trying to do.<br />
