Welcome to this website and I hope that you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
This simple website is dedicated to those diagnosed with Autism. It is here to help them to feel good about themselves, and most importantly, to feel normal.  It is also to help their family members and basically anyone else who associates with them.  I hope I accomplish this goal. If it does I would love to hear from you.<br />
<br />
I also have a passion to share knowledge when I have the ability to do so.  I hope that the resources I provide you give you greater knowledge on the subject of Autism.<br />
<br />
If this is your first time visiting this website, I first recommend that you visit the 78-page manuscript I have written with the title of <a href="https://osf.io/7mnvh/">Autistic Thinking, Literary Creativity as the Cause of Autism, and the Cure for Autism.</a><br />
<br />
I then recommend that you visit the <a href="https://osf.io/wjure/">supplemental material</a> which I have provided and includes the following 
two important documents:<br />
<br />

1.  An address given by Professor Eugen Bleuler at the opening exercises of the Henry Phipps Psychatric Clinic at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland on April 16-18, 1913.  The document this is found in has the title of autistic_thinking-eugen_bleuler.pdf.  This pdf document is 1183 pages long.  The speech is found on page 932 of the pdf document.  However, if you actually had the physical book with you it would be found on page 873.  The speech is entitled "Autistic Thinking" by Eugen Bleuler.<br />
<br />

What I have actually find to be amazing about this document is that it seems none of the professional published papers seem to reference this source.  I actually find that it gives greater insight into the subject of Autism.  Personally, I hope that it helps a little bit to change the trajectory of thinking of others about the subject of Autism.
<br />
<br />

2.  The book with the title of "Dementia praecox or the group of schizophrenias" by Professor Eugen Bleuler.  There is both the original version written in German and then there is the translated version written in English.  This book is important because it provides a description on how 
Autism became into being.  It also describes the earliest precursors 
of Autism.<br />
<br />


Another great resource for you to consider is found from the book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/metamorphosis-autism-development-Histories-Medicine/dp/0719095921/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513631452&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=metamorphosis+of+autism+by+bonnie">"The Metamorphosis of Autism: A History of Child Development in England (Social Histories of Medicine)"</a> by Bonnie Evans.  I found Bonnie Evans' book to be an absolutely fabulous resource on what has happened in the history of Autism.<br />
<br />

An important resouce is a <a href="http://simonsfoundation.s3.amazonaws.com/share/071207-leo-kanner-autistic-affective-contact.pdf">paper written by Leo Kanner in 1943.</a>  I found that the very last paragraph of this paper to be very interesting.  Pay attention to the third word of the second sentence of that paragraph.  It would be wise to ask yourself what the greater implications are of this word as it pertains to childhood Autism.<br />

<br />



A great article on the history of Asperger's Syndrome is <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02024/full">found here.</a>  This document suggests it would be wise to integrate Asperger's Syndrome into the Autism Spectrum Disorders.<br />
<br />

A wonderful <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076MCVBQH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">book on Asperger's Syndrome</a> written by Edith Sheffer is a must read.  After reading this book, I personally came away with thoughts that I wanted nothing to do with Hans Asperger.<br />
